# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was started with the [demo of Open Vector Editor](https://github.com/tnrich/ove-react-demo-repo).


## Installing

If you are using a port for the python app that is not the default one for flask (http://127.0.0.1:5000/), you have to specify the url in the variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in the .env file.

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` and the development server should be up and running.
