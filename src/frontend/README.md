# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was started with the [demo of Open Vector Editor](https://github.com/tnrich/ove-react-demo-repo).


## Installing

Set the .env var to the url of flask backend (by default it is http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` and the development server should be up and running.
