# Frontend application

This project was started with the [demo of Open Vector Editor](https://github.com/tnrich/ove-react-demo-repo).

The frontend provides web interface to generate the cloning documentation described in the main readme


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you should start the backend application. For that, see [this](../backend/readme.md=#)

If you are using a port for the python app that is not the default one for flask (http://127.0.0.1:5000/), you have to specify the url in the variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in the .env file.

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` and the development server should be up and running.
